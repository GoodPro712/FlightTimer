# FlightTimer
Flight Left Timer is a mod that counts the amount of flight time you have left. The amount left will be drawn by default in the center of the screen, however, you are able to change its position via mod config.
This mod gives you a quick config meaning if you want it turned off, it goes off instantly via the mod config.
No number will be displayed when you are not flying.
